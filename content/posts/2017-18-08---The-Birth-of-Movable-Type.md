##	UX Process

This application started with me going through a UX process multiple times. With a couple weeks I went through the cycle of completing the UX process to get my application to the best it could possibly be before I got into production. It started with general research and interviews with the product owner of what they wanted and what tech I could use to match want he wanted. Then with refining the application with user research from surveys and interviews and repeating this process I started my Low Fi designs. 

I tested these designs multiple times with user groups and one on one tests. And this UX design research caused me to have multiple changes then have my final Hi Fi to put into production.

## Production

This project used wordpress and PHP to create this template. The application had to be responsive over all devices for the clarity of the users to my product owner. The application would let the user create multiple pages and also edit any kind of contacts with making tabs and changing colours to pages of the site.
